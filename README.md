# Codewars Solutions and Tests

This repository serves as a showcase for my completed katas from Codewars.

## Getting Started

To run the tests for the solutions, you'll need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SachaWildCode/codewars-solutions-and-tests.git
cd codewars-solutions
```

### Install Dependencies
Before running the tests, install the dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the Tests

### To run all the tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```
### Running Specific Test Files

To run a specific test file using npm test, provide the path to the test file you want to execute. Replace `path/to/test/file` with the relative path to the specific test file you want to run:

```bash
npm test path/to/test/file
```
For example:
```bash
npm test tests/7kyu_folding_your_way_to_the_moon.test.ts
```
